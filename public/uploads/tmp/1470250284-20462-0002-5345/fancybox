Installation
This gem vendors jquery fancybox for Rails 3.1 and greater. The files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use.

First add the following lines to your applications Gemfile:

gem 'jquery-rails'
gem 'fancybox-rails'
Then run bundle install to update your application's bundle.

Now you need to edit your app/assets/javascripts/application.js file and add the following line:

//= require jquery
//= require fancybox
And then edit your app/assets/stylesheets/application.css file to look something like:

/*
 *= require_self
 *= require fancybox
 *= require_tree .
 */
Usage
With the gem installed and included in your asset manifests, you can now use fancybox as you normally would.

jQuery(function() {
  $("a.fancybox").fancybox();
});
If you're using CoffeeScript you can use the plugin in the same way.

jQuery ->
  $('a.fancybox').fancybox()
Customization
If you want to customize the fancybox assets you can copy the assets from the gem into your application's lib/assets/ directory.

$ rails generate fancybox_rails


<%= link_to "Show mah Fancybox!", "#hello", class: "fancybox" %>
